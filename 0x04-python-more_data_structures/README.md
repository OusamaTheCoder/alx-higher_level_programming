## Project Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on expanding your knowledge of Python's data structures, specifically sets and dictionaries. The tasks involve working with sets, dictionaries, lambda functions, and the map, reduce, and filter functions. The project is designed to enhance your understanding of when and how to use sets and dictionaries, iterating over them, and utilizing specific methods.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the advantages of Python programming.
- Understand sets, their common methods, and when to use them.
- Demonstrate proficiency in using dictionaries and making informed decisions on when to use them over lists or sets.
- Iterate through sets and dictionaries effectively.
- Recognize the key-value pairs in a dictionary and iterate over them.
- Understand lambda functions and their applications.
- Use map, reduce, and filter functions in Python.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`
- `1-search_replace.py`
- `2-uniq_add.py`
- `3-common_elements.py`
- `4-only_diff_elements.py`
- `5-number_keys.py`
- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`
- `7-update_dictionary.py`
- `8-simple_delete.py`
- `9-multiply_by_2.py`
- `10-best_score.py`
- `11-multiply_list_map.py`
- `12-roman_to_int.py`

- `101-square_matrix_map.py`
- `102-complex_delete.py`
- `103-python.c`
- `103-tests.py`
- `README.md`

## Usage

To execute the Python scripts, use the following command:

```bash
./filename.py
```

For the C file, compile and execute as follows:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 -shared -Wl,-soname,libPython.so -o libPython.so -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.4 103-python.c
python3 103-tests.py
```
