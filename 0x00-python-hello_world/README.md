## Introduction

Welcome to the Python world! In this project, you will dive into the basics of Python programming, exploring fundamental concepts and building a strong foundation. The initial projects have a "C-oriented" approach, emphasizing simplicity without intricate syntax. If you're already familiar with Python, exciting challenges await!

## Concepts

For this project, focus on the following concept:

- **Python programming**

## Author's Disclaimer

```
The journey begins! The Python projects here are designed to be straightforward, without tricky syntax. Embrace the simplicity, and as you progress, you'll discover the versatility of Python and other higher-level languages. Similar to C, Python follows a style guide called PEP8, now known as PyCode.

Enjoy your coding adventure!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without Google's help:

**General:**

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python
- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
- What is the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

**Copyright - Plagiarism:**

- You are expected to come up with solutions for the tasks independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Copying and pasting someone else’s work is not allowed.
- Publishing any content of this project is prohibited.
- Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

**Python Scripts:**

- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

**Shell Scripts:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

- Your code should use the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded


## More Information

```
**Zen of Python, by Tim Peters:**

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

**Pycodestyle:**
```

- Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code
