## Overview

This project focuses on mastering fundamental concepts in Python, including control flow structures (if/else, loops), functions, and code styling. The learning objectives cover various aspects of Python programming, emphasizing the importance of indentation, understanding control flow tools, and using functions effectively.

## Learning Objectives

- Assign values to variables and understand their role.
- Utilize while and for loops effectively.
- Differentiate Python's for loop from C's.
- Apply break and continue statements in loops.
- Understand else clauses in loops.
- Explain the purpose of the pass statement and when to use it.
- Utilize the range function for generating sequences.
- Comprehend the concept of functions and how to use them.
- Understand the behavior of functions without a return statement.
- Grasp the scope of variables in Python.
- Define and understand a traceback.
- Familiarize yourself with arithmetic operators and their usage.
